# VS Code

VS Code (Visual Studio Code) is a free, open-source code editor developed by Microsoft. It was first released in 2015 and has since become one of the most popular code editors among developers.

VS Code provides a range of features that make it a highly flexible and powerful tool for coding. It supports a wide range of programming languages and frameworks, and provides features such as syntax highlighting, code completion, debugging, and Git integration.

One of the key strengths of VS Code is its extensibility. It has a large and active community of developers who create and maintain extensions, which can be used to add new features or functionality to the editor. This allows users to customize the editor to their specific needs and preferences.

Another important feature of VS Code is its integrated terminal, which allows users to run commands and interact with their code directly within the editor. This can save developers time and help to streamline their workflow.
