summary: A fancy markdown editor for knowledge management
---

Obsidian is a note-taking and knowledge management application that allows users to create and organize notes, ideas, and information in a highly interconnected way. It was created by a team of developers led by Erica Xu and Shida Li, and was first released in 2019.

Obsidian uses a [[Markdown]]-based editor, which means that users can format their notes using Markdown syntax, and can easily create headings, lists, links, and other formatting elements. One of the key features of Obsidian is its ability to create backlinks between notes, which allows users to easily see how different pieces of information are connected to each other. This can help users to build a more comprehensive understanding of a particular topic or project.

Another important feature of Obsidian is its graph view, which provides a visual representation of the connections between different notes. This can be a useful tool for exploring relationships between different pieces of information and for identifying areas where additional research or knowledge is needed.

Obsidian also offers a range of customization options, including the ability to create custom themes and plugins, which allows users to tailor the application to their specific needs and preferences.
